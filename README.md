mypacket project
=================
This is the Opendaylight demo project for sending any raw packet-data to network.
It works on :
* Opendaylight version: Boron-SR1, Beryllium-SR+, and previous version


# Introduction
In Opendaylight, "PacketProcessingService" interface provide the ability to send any raw packet-data to network.
This service can be obtained from "model-flow-service" with bundle openflowplugin.

Rest API of "packet-processing(2013-07-09)" is another method to deliver raw packet-data from controller 
through specific switch to network. A concrete JSON format is giving below.

## PacketProcessingService
The service is provided by openflowplugin.
* How to get the service and transmit raw packet to data-path.
* Define yang model and RPC interface, then receive user's input data

## packet-processing(2013-07-09)
This Rest API is flexible and powerful to deliver raw packet-data from controller through 
specific switch to network, and can be used in any software environment.
Here is a sample JSON format:
```
Url = http://<controller-ip>:8181/restconf/operations/packet-processing:transmit-packet
Method = POST
Content-type: application/json
Accept: application/json
JSON-data = {"input": {"action": [{"order": "1", "set-dl-dst-action": {"address": "00:0C:29:C8:96:6A"}}, {"order": "10", "output-action": {"output-node-connector": "openflow:11:2"}}], "connection-cookie": 123456, "egress": "/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/opendaylight-inventory:node[opendaylight-inventory:id='openflow:11']/opendaylight-inventory:node-connector[opendaylight-inventory:id='openflow:11:2']", "node": "/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/opendaylight-inventory:node[opendaylight-inventory:id='openflow:11']", "payload": "QAwpyJZqAAwp06cxCABFAAA8fR0AAEABaCjAqAoVwKgKFggATJcCAP7EYWJjZGVmZ2hpamtsbW5vcHFyc3R1dndhYmNkZWZnaGk="}}


```
